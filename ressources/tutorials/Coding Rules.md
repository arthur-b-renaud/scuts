# Coding Rules

Code *everything* in English. 

Use docstrings.

Explicit is better than implicit. => Use long names for variables and functions.

Don't use classes unless sure it helps.

Don't use functions unless you use them more than 3 times.

Flat is better than nested => use a dataframe / a sqlite rather than a nested dictionary.

Errors should never pass silently. => print traceback and use try/excepts only when needed.
